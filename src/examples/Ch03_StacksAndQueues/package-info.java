/**
 * Stacks and Queues Motha Fucka

 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Stacks ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * The stack data structure is precisely what it sounds like: a stack of data.
 **
 * In certain types of problems, it can be favorable to store data in a stack rather than in an array.
 * A stack uses LIFO (last-in first-out) ordering. That is, as in a stack of dinner plates, the most recent item
 * added to the stack is the first item to be removed.
 *
 * It uses the following operations:
 *
 * pop () : Remove the top item from the stack.
 * push (item): Add an item to the top of the stack.
 * peek(): Return the top of the stack.
 * is Empty (): Return true if and only if the stack is empty.
 *
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Queues ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * A queue implements FIFO (first-in first-out) ordering. As in a line or queue at a ticket stand, items are
 * removed from the data structure in the same order that they are added.
 *
 * It uses the operations:
 *
 * add (item): Add an item to the end of the list.
 * remove (): Remove the first item in the list.
 * peek () : Return the top of the queue.
 * is Empty(): Return true if and only if the queue is empty.
